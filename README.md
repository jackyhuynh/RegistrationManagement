# RegistrationSystem
Registration System is a group project using C++. Registration System work as its name, a registration system for students. The application contains three data structures (binary search tree, heap, and a hashtable). Data will be read and store in the three data structures. A control manager will manage the insert, update, and delete each Object on all the data structures. There also helpers objects (File-Reader, Student, and Data) was implemented to ensure program security and abstract design.

## Technology:
C++, Pointer, Object-Oriented Design, Encapsulation, Data Structures, Algorithm, Memory Management

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Visual Studio: If install visual studio to run this program only will be a waste of time. I highly recommend using Linux Command Line (g++) instead. If Visual Studio already install on your computer this will be nice
- Command-Prompt for Visual Studio: Same go here. For this particular project, I highly recommend using Command-Prompt instead of the IDE.
- Linux: Program can be run on Linux System (if you familiar with Linux command line). 
Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

 Visual Studio

```
* [Install Visual Studio: C, C++ Enviroment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160#:~:text=Visual%20Studio%202019%20Installation%201%20Make%20sure%20your,...%204%20Choose%20workloads.%20...%20More%20items...)
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
