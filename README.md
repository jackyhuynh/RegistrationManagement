# RegistrationSystem
Registration System is a group project using C++. Registration System work as its name, a registration system for students. The application contains three data structures (binary search tree, heap, and a hashtable). Data will be read and store in the three data structures. A control manager will manage the insert, update, and delete each Object on all the data structures. There also helpers objects (File-Reader, Student, and Data) was implemented to ensure program security and abstract design. The idea with three data sucture is for back up and Optimized Search Engine. Each data sucture is perform diffrent on each Search.

## Technology
C++, Pointer, Object-Oriented Design, Encapsulation, Pollymorphism, Data Structures, Algorithm, Memory Management

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Visual Studio: If install visual studio to run this program only will be a waste of time. I highly recommend using Linux Command Line (g++) instead. If Visual Studio already install on your computer this will be nice
- Command-Prompt for Visual Studio: Same go here. For this particular project, I highly recommend using Command-Prompt instead of the IDE.
- Linux: Program can be run on Linux System (if you familiar with Linux command line). 
- Any C/C++ compiler: If you have any compiler that already install then I highly recommend use your own compiler with out installing anything (time consuming).
Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

 Visual Studio & Command-Prompt for Visual Studio:

* [Install Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-160#:~:text=Visual%20Studio%202019%20Installation%201%20Make%20sure%20your,...%204%20Choose%20workloads.%20...%20More%20items...) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Visual Studio and the Microsoft C/C++ tools yet, here's how to get started.
* [Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs#:~:text=%20Developer%20Command%20Prompt%20for%20Visual%20Studio%20,from%20inside%20Visual%20Studio.%20For%20easier...%20More) - Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio enables you to use .NET Framework tools more easily. It's a command prompt that automatically sets specific environment variables. After opening Developer Command Prompt, you can enter the commands for .NET Framework tools such as ildasm or clrver.

Linux Ubuntu 18.4 LTS
* [Linux Ubuntu 18.4 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) can be download at Microsoft Store

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
* [Linux Compilers](https://askubuntu.com/questions/61408/what-is-a-command-to-compile-and-run-c-programs#:~:text=The%20simplest%20way%20to%20compile%20a%20C%2B%2B%20program,only%20compiler%20capable%20of%20compiling%20the%20Linux%20kernel.)- Locate the home folder that contain the program (by using the cd command). Call the g++ compiler and execute.
* [Visual Studio Command Line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compiling-a-native-cpp-program-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160
)

## Deployment

Can be deploy to any embedded system without any problem. Can also make API or libary using this. 

## Built With

* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - The full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Android, iOS, Windows, web, and cloud 
* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) -  Free. Cross-platform. Open source. A developer platform for building Internet of Thing(IOT), Microservices, Desktop, Cloud, Mobile, Machine Learning, Web, Game.
